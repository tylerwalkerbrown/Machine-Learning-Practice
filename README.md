# Machine-Learning-Practice

Here is where I showcase some of my general machine learning practice. Currently working though getting fimiliar/refreshing myself on ML models. This is aside from my other personal portfolio projects that I am pursuing. Each folder contains a difference ML model that I practiced with whiteboard activities and studied. Goal is to work through these models to showcase:

### Supervised ML
#### Linear Models:
- Linear Regression 
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

#### Tree-based Models:
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting Regression 
- XG Boost
- LightGBM Regressor 

#### Clustering
- K-means
- Heirachical Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models
