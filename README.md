# Self Guided Machine Learning Practice

Here is where I showcase some of my general machine learning practice. Currently working though getting fimiliar/refreshing myself on ML models. This is aside from my other personal portfolio projects that I am pursuing. Each folder contains a difference ML model that I practiced with whiteboard activities and studied. Goal is to work through these models to showcase:

## Experience With 
#### Linear Models:
- Linear Regression ✔️
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/tylerwalkerbrown/Machine-Learning-Practice/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Telco%20Optimization/Telco-Logistic-Regression-Optimization.ipynb) ✔️
#### Tree-based Models:
- [Decision Tree (Regressor/Classifier)](https://github.com/tylerwalkerbrown/Hackathon-Fun/blob/main/Participants_Data/D_T_Regression.ipynb)✔️
- Random Forests ✔️
#### Clustering
- [K-means](https://github.com/tylerwalkerbrown/Warehouse-Optimization) ✔️
- Heirachical Clustering ✔️

#### Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models 

# Deep Learning

Once I complete all models listed I will then be showcasing deep learning model. Deep learning I have worked with in the past but need to conceptualize the models.

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- AlexNet
- VGGNet
- ResNet
- InceptionNet
- MobileNet
- DenseNet
