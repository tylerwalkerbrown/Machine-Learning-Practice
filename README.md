# Self Guided Machine Learning Practice

Here is where I showcase some of my general machine learning practice. Currently working though getting fimiliar/refreshing myself on ML models. This is aside from my other personal portfolio projects that I am pursuing. Each folder contains a difference ML model that I practiced with whiteboard activities and studied. Goal is to work through these models to showcase:

### Supervised ML
#### Linear Models:
- Linear Regression 
- Logistic Regression ✔️ (3/28/23)
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

#### Tree-based Models:
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forests 
- Gradient Boosting Regression 
- XG Boost
- LightGBM Regressor 
- Adaboost ✔️ (3/31/23)

#### Supervised ML

#### Clustering
- K-means
- Heirachical Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models 

# Deep Learning

Once I complete all models listed I will then be showcasing deep learning model. Deep learning I have worked with in the past but these are models I will be learning about.

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- AlexNet
- VGGNet
- ResNet
- InceptionNet
- MobileNet
- DenseNet
